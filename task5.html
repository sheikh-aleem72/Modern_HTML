      <h2>1. Semantic Elements</h2>
      <p>
        HTML5 introduces a set of semantic elements that provide a more
        meaningful way to structure your web content. These include elements
        like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;,
        which make it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to
        understand the content and its structure.

      <h2>2. Audio and Video Support</h2>
      <p>
        HTML5 includes built-in support for embedding audio and video content
        without the need for third-party plugins like Flash. You can use the
        &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements to easily include multimedia
        content on your web pages. This enhances the user experience and makes
        it more accessible across various devices and browsers.

      <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
      <p>
        HTML5 introduces the <em>localStorage</em> and
        <em>sessionStorage</em> APIs, which allow you to store data locally in a
        user's browser. This feature is useful for creating web applications
        that can work offline or store user preferences. Unlike cookies, local
        storage provides a larger storage capacity and is more secure.
